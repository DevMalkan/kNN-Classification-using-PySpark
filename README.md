# Big Data Processing Project

- Implemented an iterative Spark-based method leveraging parallel processing for k-nearest neighbor classification to
reduce time by 90% without exceeding memory limit.

- Achieved significant performance gains with Spark-based kNN implementation, resulting in a 1000x speedup over
sequential kNN and a 10x improvement compared to traditional Hadoop Map-Reduce.
